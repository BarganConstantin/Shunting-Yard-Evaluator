# Abstract


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is surprising the transformation of algorithmic thinking, from a particular mathematical tool, into a fundamental way of approaching problems in fields that apparently have nothing to do with mathematics. This universality of algorithmic thinking is the result of the connection between the algorithm and the computer. Today, by algorithm we mean a general method of solving a certain type of problem, a method that can be implemented on a computer. In this context, an algorithm is the absolute essence of a routine. Basically, it was found that there is no field, no matter how inaccurate and fluctuating it may seem, in which we cannot discover algorithmically functioning sectors.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project, we analyzed and implemented the Shunting Yard algorithm, which is very important
because it simplified calculations in digital devices, and gave a new concept on technologies.
The report includes 5 chapters, because the study of algorithms involves several aspects, and before
reaching the implementation we must understand the problem that solves it and how, so the first three sections
are based on determining the problem, solution, principle of operation, complexity and of course the structural
description of the system.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, for a given problem, we should find several algorithms, and then choose the best one from
them. But what is the criterion for comparison? The efficiency of an algorithm can be expressed in several
ways. We can analyze a empirically the behavior of the algorithm after implementation, by running different
cases on the computer. Or, we can analyze a theoretically the algorithm, before programming it, by
quantitatively determining the resources (time, memory) needed as a function of the size of the case considered,
theoretically in a similar way. Memory-execution time issues can also arise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter four describes the backend mode, the implementation of the algorithm in code, explains the
data structures we will use, what operations we will perform with them, what language we will use. And this
is very important, because the operation of the whole program depends on this compartment.
In turn, chapter five describes the frontend module, which is just as important as the mechanism by
which the user will communicate with the program, and if it is convenient and has a pleasant appearance, the
user experience will be a good one.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding this algorithm, will bring us closer to knowing what is going on behind different highperformance programming languages, because the act of creating an algorithm is an art that can never be fully automated. It is basically the universal mechanism of human creativity, which produces the new through an extremely complex synthesis such as: elaboration techniques (rules) + creativity (intuition) = solution.
