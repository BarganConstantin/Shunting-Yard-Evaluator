			<p>The restaurant was opened in Bangkok, Thailand, by Indian chef Gaggan Anand in 2010, who had lived in Bangkok since 2007. He sought to refine Indian food to the same fine dining level as seen by other styles of cuisine such as French or Japanese within Thailand. The restaurant is located in a former 19th century townhouse. While the property was being renovated prior to opening, the 2010 Thai political protests took place meaning that Anand couldn't visit the restaurant for a period of time.[3] The interior decor has a running color scheme of white and beige throughout, but there are additions of neon purple lights and scatter cushions in a variety of colors. The restaurant's dining area spreads across two floors which remain in a series of small enclosed rooms.</p>
