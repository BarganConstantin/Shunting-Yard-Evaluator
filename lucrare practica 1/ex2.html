			<p>Noma's original location was in an old warehouse on the waterfront in the Christianshavn neighbourhood in central Copenhagen.

The building is situated by the Greenlandic Trading Square (Danish: Gr√∏nlandske Handels Plads), which for 200 years was a centre for trade to and from the Faroe Islands, Finnmark, Iceland, and in particular, Greenland. Dry fish, salted herring, whale oil and skins are among the goods that were stored in and around the warehouse before being sold off to European markets.

In 2003, the warehouse was turned into North Atlantic House, a centre for the art and culture of the North Atlantic region.[8] Noma was opened at the same time by Redzepi and Claus Meyer.[1] [9] The restaurant's interior is designed by Space Copenhagen.[10]

Between 12 and 16 February 2013, 63 of 435 diners took ill after eating at Noma, according to a Danish Food Administration report. The symptoms were attributed to norovirus, which was believed to have been unintentionally spread by an infected kitchen employee.

Redzepi planned to close Noma after 31 December 2016 and reopen it in 2017 as an urban farm near Copenhagen.

Noma reopened on 15 February 2018 after a year hiatus.[16] The restaurant itself also moved from its previous Strandgade location, now housing Restaurant Barr, to its current location on Refshalevej.</p>
